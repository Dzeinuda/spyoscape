# spyoscape

**SPYOSCAPE** is a (work in progress) hobby project that aiming to localise and map the artwork of the Danish graffiti artist **SPYO**. The artwork included on this site contains only political statements, phrases or alike. This means that regular tags and throwups etc. are not mapped.

Am I missing something?
You are very welcome to create a pull request with images of artwork I have not yet mapped. The process for doing so is described at the [contribution](#contribution) section. Thank you for stopping by!
